# NBA-Prediction-

## Objectives

• The goal of this project is to predict upcoming NBA game result based on team stats
and ELO Ratings. On our research we found that the already built predicting models
were using different features like FGA, FGM, 3ptPct, 3pA etc (other than Elo rating
and recent team performances) have low accuracy. So we are looking to develop a
model that used ELO ratings as well as other features to predict the game outcome as
the win % depends on the individual team performance as well

• To compare the players more easily based on their past performances we will use
different data visualizing techniques using tableau. By this we can sort or filter
players and rank them according to their various features.
